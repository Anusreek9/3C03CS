       A beautiful combination of greenery and azure skies welcome backpackers to Kumarakom. A walk through God’s garden, the paddy fields of Kumarakom, is an enriching and humbling experience. It renders a feeling of refreshment just as exploring the State’s backyard beverage-toddy fills one with warmth and wonder. This tepid mild alcoholic drink made from the fermented sap of the coconut palm tree is a unique brew. The backwater cruises in Kumarakom offer a distinctive and ravishing experience which will last a lifetime.
